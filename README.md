## Run Locally

- This project uses a mongo database hosted in [mLab](https://mlab.com/home) so, no further configuration is needed for the database.

- To run the front-end/back-end locally, go to the root folder `game-of-drones` and run `npm run build` and then `npm run start` in your command line. This will run both server and client.
- Client can be accessed via `http://localhost:3000/`
